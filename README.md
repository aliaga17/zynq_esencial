# zynq_esencial
This repository contains the laboratories for the course "Zynq Esencial", along with variations to those to play with them and make sure I undertsand what is going on.

I carried out this course using an HTG-ZRF8 board and a Zynq Ultrascale+ RFSoC as opposed to the setup used by the instructor (PicoZed card (Zynq7000) and FMC Carrier Card V2). The Vivado PS instantiation and constraint files have been modified accordingly.

The corresponding course can be found here: https://www.udemy.com/share/10at9a3@yt8VmLyclRVHq8kwpy1cLW_-NSKaL4mPLa41ZOL5BkaXbcn5FtZ8Ahrrscqo9dUYeQ==/
